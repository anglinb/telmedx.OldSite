	   telmedx Announces Joint Venture With Febit of Poland
         <br /><i>Medical-Grade Mobile Video System Provides Broader Access to Healthcare</i></h3>
        San Diego CA - March 6, 2013 - After being named one of the top three Most Promising Companies of 2013 at the recent Personalized Medicine World Conference in Silicon Valley, San Diego-based telemedicine company telmedx announces a joint venture established with Febit Ltd. (Febit Sp. z o.o.) of Wroclaw, Poland, to market, deploy and support the telmedx telemedicine platform in Poland and several other countries in Eastern Europe, including the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and Russia.
        <br /><br />
        With telmedx, a doctor or other medical professional can connect to a patient's mobile phone for a live video and high quality audio medical consult using a Web browser on any computer or tablet. In addition to delivering high quality audio with simultaneous live video, the medical professional can also control the camera in the mobile phone to capture high-resolution still images to see greater detail of a patient's medical condition to make an initial patient assessment, diagnose a condition, manage follow up care and health status monitoring, or confirm compliance with protocols and procedures in drug treatment programs or clinical trials.
        <br /><br />
       "Countries throughout Europe face healthcare delivery problems today similar to the challenges faced in the United States with an aging population, rising costs and decreasing access to healthcare," stated Richard Anglin, CEO of telmedx. "At the same time, the dominant national health service systems are being restructured to encourage private healthcare providers to work with the National Health Service, and in some cases to compete with it. We see this a great time to introduce our live mobile video telemedicine platform into Eastern Europe, and telmedx is extremely excited to work with Febit to increase access to healthcare and to increase quality of care."
        <br /><br />
        Febit is an Information Technology (IT) company with broad experience in developing and deploying IT solutions in various market segments, including telecommunications, electronic commerce, commerce and image processing. "Febit sees tremendous opportunities for telmedx in Poland and neighboring countries," stated Zbigniew Blaszczyk, Founder, President and CEO of Febit. "We have relationships with a number of the largest private health plans in Poland and other nearby countries that are looking for telehealth solutions, and the telmedx platform is a valuable extension of their services."
        <br /><br />
        "With an increasing demand to remotely care for patients and manage clinical trials with fewer resources, the telmedx mobile video telemedicine system is a perfect fit today for helping doctors make remote assessments more easily, for National Health Systems to monitor patients and prevent readmissions, and for drug development companies to confirm protocols and procedures for clinical trial with high quality, live video interactions from a Web browser to a mobile phone," continued Blaszczyk. "The telmedx solution is launching the next generation of healthcare throughout the world."

	    San Diego's telmedx Begins Operations at Janssen Labs</h3>
        San Diego CA - February 18, 2013 - After being named one of the top three Most Promising Companies of 2013 at the recent Personalized Medicine World Conference in Silicon Valley, San Diego-based telemedicine company telmedx has now moved its operations to Janssen Labs in the Torrey Pines area of San Diego.
        <br /><br />
        Janssen Labs is located at Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. in San Diego, CA. Janssen Labs is a 32,000-square-foot life science innovation center, located within the Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC's West Coast Research Center.

        <br /><br />
        "We are excited about the opportunity to operate within the collaborative environment at Janssen Labs in San Diego," stated Richard Anglin, CEO of
telmedx. "The unique technology of telmedx has a wide range of applications in the delivery of medical care and also in verifying protocols and procedures for life sciences and drug development companies.

    <h3><span>01/30/13</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
	    San Diego's telmedx One of Most Promising Companies at Personalized Medicine World Conference 2013</h3>
		San Diego CA - January 30, 2013 - San Diego-based telemedicine company telmedx (<a href="http://www.telmedx.com">www.telmedx.com</a>) was selected as one of top three Most Promising Companies of 2013 at the exclusive Personalized Medicine World Conference in Mountain View, California. The Personalized Medicine World Conference (<a href="http://2013sv.pmwcintl.com" target="_blank">http://2013sv.pmwcintl.com</a>) brought together thought-leaders of business, government, healthcare-delivery, research and technology in the only fully-integrated conference to examine the advances and challenges of Personalized Medicine through a practical lens.<br /><br />
At the conference, telmedx competed among other pre-selected, emerging companies that are defining the next generation of platforms and technologies in healthcare. With the telmedx system, doctors can remotely examine patients over cell phone cameras and capture high resolution still images simply by logging onto an Internet browser on any computer or tablet.<br /><br />
Diego Miralles, M.D., Director of Janssen Research &amp; Development and Janssen Healthcare Innovation in San Diego, joined leading venture capitalists from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, Sequoia Capital, InterWest Partners, Physic Ventures, Geisinger Ventures and others as judges for the Most Promising Company competition.<br /><br />
"Our team is delighted that telmedx has been named one of the top three emerging companies at the Personalized Medicine World Conference. Doctors today need better tools to examine and diagnose more patients more quickly and with more flexibility outside of facilities, and telmedx allows medical professionals to examine patients anytime, anywhere over cell phone cameras," stated Richard Anglin, CEO of
telmedx. "With our unique technology connecting doctors on a Web browser to the cell phone camera of patients, medical providers can avoid preventable readmissions, and avoid the penalties already being handed down under new healthcare regulations. We have re-invented the house call and made it better."
<br /><br />
The telmedx telemedicine platform differs from other mobile video providers by combining live video, high quality audio and remote image capture to allow medical professionals to make simple assessments remotely, increasing efficiency and helping deliver better medical outcomes.<br /><br />
A 2010 study by Price WaterhouseCoopers on excess and waste in healthcare costs found that needless Emergency Room (ER) visits cost the U.S. healthcare system $14 billion per year, and preventable hospital readmissions contribute an additional $25 billion in waste. Through consultations with a number of doctors, telmedx estimates that without visual information about the patient, triaging caregivers needlessly send about twenty-four percent (24%) of patients to the ER. Millions of dollars per month per medical provider can potentially be saved in avoidable ER visits and preventable readmissions. The cell phone-based telemedicine platform of telmedx can address these issues and others, and is currently deployed in usability trials demonstrating better medical outcomes and lower costs.<br /><br />
"The telmedx mobile phone video system is a perfect fit today for helping doctors make simple assessments more easily. It is also a valuable risk management tool to help manage patient follow up care. We are excited about the interest telmedx has received around the world as healthcare innovators," continued Anglin.<br /><br />
