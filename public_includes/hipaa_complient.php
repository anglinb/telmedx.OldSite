	<p>HIPAA-compliant technology is the key to cell phone video<br />
	<br />telmedx is a HIPAA- and HITECH-compliant telemedicine platform that provides live medicalgrade video and high-resolution remote image capture from a patient's cell phone.<br />
	<br />Our secure and HIPAA-certified server does not allow patients, clinicians or anyone to watch the video from within the server - it can only be seen on the clinician's computer connected to the patient. We can authenticate which computers had a transmission with which cell phone on a certain day at a certain time, over a certain period of time, but the video and images cannot be seen by third parties.<br />
	<br />Our technology responds to medical requirements and easily integrates into existing hospital and clinic practices because no new hardware, devices, phone systems or other equipment is needed - only Internet access with any browser on a computer or tablet is required.</p>
