	<p>telmedx reinvents the house call so doctors can remotely examine patients anytime, anywhere.<br />
	<br />Live video sessions can easily be accessed via Web browsers on an office or personal computer, laptop or tablet connected to the Internet. Multiple clinicians in multiple locations can access the same live cell phone video over Web browsers, and each has the ability to independently capture high-resolution images from that same video, thereby making consultations seamless.<br />
	<br />Our technology responds to medical requirements and easily integrates into existing hospital and clinic practices because no new hardware, devices, phone systems or other equipment is needed - only Internet access is needed is required</p>
