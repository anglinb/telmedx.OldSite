	<p>Home of Guiding Hands (HGH) operates thirty-one residential care facilities for developmentally disabled children, adolescents and adults dispersed throughout the community.  A nurse is responsible for three to five homes, each home having four to six residents.  The nurses are on call 24/7/365 and must physically visit a home to evaluate a patient upon the occurrence of a medical incident.  For the usability trial two HGH residences have WiFi and an Apple&reg; iPod Touch&reg; with the telmedx telemedicine application installed.  Residential caregivers call the responsible nurse who initiates a video session via a Web browser at home.  They can see the resident's condition, evaluate whether they need to travel to the residence, as well as give care direction.  This procedure reduces the workload burden on the nurses and resident caregivers, and shortens the time for care delivery to the residents.  At least one potential Emergency Room visit was eliminated in the first two weeks of the trial.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.guidinghands.org">www.guidinghands.org</a></p>
