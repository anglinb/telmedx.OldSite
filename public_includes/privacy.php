When a doctor or other clinician connects to a patientâ€™s cell phone, telmedx is primarily interested in the number of video sessions held each day, where they were located, the amount of time they lasted, and similar technical information such as which cell phone number was connected to which computer.  Again, we do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to any third party.
